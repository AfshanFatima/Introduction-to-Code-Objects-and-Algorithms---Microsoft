### Pre Assessment
As this course covers more advanced concepts in Java it is important you are already comfortable with basic Java syntax. The following  should help you evaluate your readiness for this course. If you find that you cannot follow through, we suggest you go back and take our first course ["Introduction to Java"](https://www.edx.org/course/learn-to-program-in-java-1).

### [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV277x+2T2018/course/)

Welcome to "Algorithms and Data Structures". In this course we will use be using human language (aka: pseudo code) to learn most of the fundamental topics so it can be applicable to multiple programming languages. But in order to provide real examples and exercises, we have to code in a programming language. For now, we will choose Java as our programming language in this course.

Practice
As you move through the course you'll notice that we are providing the basic code implementation of the concepts explained. For each lesson, We would like you to watch the videos, read the text and understand the coding examples.

Then, put all of the lesson contents away and practice. Start with planning, write down what you are going to implement based on your understanding in pseudo code first. Then, launch your IDE and translate that to code. Do your best before you look back at the given code. If you weren't able to code it, please try and go back to the concept not to the given code. Now give it another shot to code it your self. Once you have your own working code, now go back and compare it with our given code. See the similarities and differences. Sometimes it could be different implementations, and this is a great start because the idea behind this course is to get you to understand and assess these differences.

Doing these self-practices is crucial to you fully understanding the material.
