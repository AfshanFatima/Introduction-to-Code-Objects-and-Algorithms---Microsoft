### Pre Assessment
As this course covers more advanced concepts in Java it is important you are already comfortable with basic Java syntax. The following should help you evaluate your readiness for this course. If you find that you cannot follow through, we suggest you go back and take our first course ["Introduction to Java"](https://www.edx.org/course/learn-to-program-in-java-1).

## Object Oriented Programming in Java

### Module 1: What is an Object?
If you took our previous course "Introduction to Java" you should be familiar with the basics of Java syntax and "procuedural programming". In our first module you'll build on that understanding as we talk about the different types of objects that Java provides for you to use, and how those are different from primitive types of data.

**In this module we'll cover…**
* the difference between working with primitive and an object data
* how to better organize groups of data with arrays, both one and two dimensional
* the Java list class and the implementation ArrayList

### Module 2: Building Your Own Objects
Now that you have plenty of experience using objects, in this module we are going to learn how to create our own. Organizing your code into objects will help you manage your data and build a complex code base that is broken into manageable and modular pieces. Object oriented programming emerged as a solution to the explosion of complexity of software systems in the 1980s as increasingly large programming teams were required to delivery larger and larger systems. As code bases grew it became more and more difficult to manage how pieces of code interacted, thus object oriented design was developed to improve manageability.

**In this module we'll cover…*
* How to write your own object
* How to properly encapsulate your object to protect your code from user interference
* How to leverage static elements to reduce redundancy

### Module 3: Object Inheritance
Once you are comfortable creating individual objects, it is important to start relating objects to one another and building strong bonds and relationships throughout your code base. This will help structure your code for easy maintenance and updates as you continue to grow your code base. Inheritance is a way to formalize relationships between objects that share behavior.

**In this module we'll cover…**
* how to use inheritance to form family relationships between objects
* leveraging the bonds between the super class and its children to create well structured code
* how polymorphism comes into play as you add more levels of inheritance
* how to leverage abstract classes and interfaces to build on top of the relationships you've built with inheritance

### Module 4 Capstone Project
**Final Project - Animal Kingdom**
This assignment will give you practice with defining classes. You are to write a set of classes that define the behavior of certain animals. You will be given a program that runs a simulation of a world with many animals wandering around in it. Different kinds of animals will behave in different ways and you are defining those differences.

For this assignment, you will be given a lot of supporting code that runs the simulation.
