## [Introduction to Code Objects and Algorithms](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/0beb9268-6047-43b5-8be4-55dcc45be396/)

These three courses is a part of Code Objects and Algorithms Program -Microsoft.
 
### [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV285x+3T2018/course/)

Welcome to "Algorithms and Data Structures". In this course we will use be using human language (aka: pseudo code) to learn most of the fundamental topics so it can be applicable to multiple programming languages. But in order to provide real examples and exercises, we have to code in a programming language. For now, we will choose Java as our programming language in this course.

Practice
As you move through the course you'll notice that we are providing the basic code implementation of the concepts explained. For each lesson, We would like you to watch the videos, read the text and understand the coding examples.

Then, put all of the lesson contents away and practice. Start with planning, write down what you are going to implement based on your understanding in pseudo code first. Then, launch your IDE and translate that to code. Do your best before you look back at the given code. If you weren't able to code it, please try and go back to the concept not to the given code. Now give it another shot to code it your self. Once you have your own working code, now go back and compare it with our given code. See the similarities and differences. Sometimes it could be different implementations, and this is a great start because the idea behind this course is to get you to understand and assess these differences.

Doing these self-practices is crucial to you fully understanding the material.

### [Learn to Program in Java](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV276x+2T2018/course/)

**What you'll learn**
* Basic Java commands and APIs using industry tools
* Foundational data organization and manipulation
* Code control structures, such as loops and if/else statements
* How to structure code using methods, parameters, and returns

### [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV277x+2T2018/course/)

**In this Project we'll coverâ€¦**
* the difference between working with primitive and an object data
* how to better organize groups of data with arrays, both one and two dimensional
* the Java list class and the implementation ArrayList
* How to write your own object
* How to properly encapsulate your object to protect your code from user interference
* How to leverage static elements to reduce redundancy
* how to use inheritance to form family relationships between objects
* leveraging the bonds between the super class and its children to create well structured code
* how polymorphism comes into play as you add more levels of inheritance
* how to leverage abstract classes and interfaces to build on top of the relationships you've built with   inheritance
* You are to write a set of classes that define the behavior of certain animals. You will be given a       program that runs a simulation of a world with many animals wandering around in it. Different kinds of   animals will behave in different ways and you are defining those differences.

For this assignment, you will be given a lot of supporting code that runs the simulation.
