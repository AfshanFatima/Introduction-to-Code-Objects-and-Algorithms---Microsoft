# [Learn To Program In Java](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV276x+2T2018/course/)

**Welcome to "Learn to Program in Java".**

In this course we are going to be learning to code using a programming language called "Java". For this course you'll need a computer that can handle some heavy programs and computing. For more details you can see Oracle's list of machine requirements for running Java here. In the next section we'll walk you through exactly how to set up a machine to work with Java.

Ready to start your programming journey? Being a software engineer is much more than simply writing code—it requires a strong conceptual understanding of computer science. In this course, which was developed through a combination of academic and industry perspectives, learn not only how to code in Java but also how to break down problems and implement their solutions using some of the most fundamental computer science tools.

Get plenty of hands-on Java coding experience with methods, logic, loops, variables, parameters, returns, and recursion. And write your code using industry-standard tools and practices to help you build strong habits as you grow your development skill set.

Whether you are preparing for advanced university computer science courses, an entry-level software engineering position, or the Advanced Placement Computer Science A exam, get the tools you need to succeed in this practical, self-paced Java course.

**What you'll learn**
* Basic Java commands and APIs using industry tools
* Foundational data organization and manipulation
* Code control structures, such as loops and if/else statements
* How to structure code using methods, parameters, and returns


**Course Syllabus**
* Module 1 – Java Basics
* Module 2 – Control Structures
* Module 3 – Data Flow
* Module 4 – Capstone Project

### Module 1: Java Basics
In our first module, you'll learn the basics of the Java programming language. We'll focus on building your comfort and familiarity with the syntax of the language while giving you the building blocks that you will use throughout the rest of the course.

**IN THIS MODULE WE'LL COVER…**

* Writing your first Java program
* The different parts of a Java program
* Printing text to the console
* Organizing your code using methods
* How Java views and stores basic types of data
* Different methods of manipulating data
* How to create programs that allow a user to interact with the software

### Module 2: Control Structures
In our second module, you'll learn how to solve problems using computer logic. The foundation of all computers is a switch- true or false, 0 or 1, and understanding how to break down problems to that type of thinking will help you translate human problems into computer solutions.

**IN THIS MODULE WE'LL COVER…**

* The basic unit of logic- the boolean
* Conditional programming with if else statements
* Using loops to save repetitive code and leverage patterns. Loops like:
  * for loops
  * while loops
  * nested loops

### Module 3: Data Flow
In our third and final content module you'll learn more tools to modularize and better structure your code. We'll focus on how data can be moved from one piece of code to another and how that makes your code more readable and easier to maintain.

**IN THIS MODULE WE'LL COVER...**

* How to pass information into a method using parameters
* How to get information out of a method using returns
* Useful methods provided by Java's built in Math and String classes
* How to build and read recursive based algorithms

### Module 4: Maze Runner
Let the user solve the maze

**Final Project - Maze Runner**

For your final project you will be writing the code for "MazeRunner", a program that navigates through a given maze. The code for the Maze is already written, and provided in "Maze.java". You just need to write the code that uses Maze and decides how to move through it.

**Practice**
As you move through the course you'll notice some concepts have a "practice" section. These are links to problems on a site called "Practice-It". Practice-it is a web app operated by the University of Washington, but it's free for anyone to use. You'll need to go to https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/ and create an account to access the problems.

**Textbook**
This course is designed based on a traditional university approach to learning to program. Thus it generally follows the requirements for any first level computer science course. It is not required, but if you find textbooks helpful we personally suggest "Building Java Programs" by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp. You can find out more about it at www.buildingjavaprograms.com.

**AP Exam**
Due to the academic nature of this course it is a good companion for preparing for the College Board's [Advanced Placement Computer Science A Exam](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a?course=ap-computer-science-a).

This course only covers the first half of the AP exam, so we suggest continuing your test prep with the next courses in this series "Object Oriented Programming in Java", "Algorithms and Data Structures" also from Microsoft. 

## [Introduction to Code Objects and Algorithms](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/0beb9268-6047-43b5-8be4-55dcc45be396/)

These three courses is a part of Code Objects and Algorithms Program -Microsoft.
